## Quick Pitch

"I packaged up my idea management system as a production-ready tool.

It solves the context loss problem in AI development - lets you work on 150 ideas instead of 1-3.

Install: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauljump/idea-factory/main/install.sh | bash`

Try: `if-setup test-idea`

I'm managing 150 projects with it. Would love your thoughts!"

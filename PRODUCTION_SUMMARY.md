✅ **Branded CLI** - `if-setup`, `if-sync`, `if-analytics`
✅ **Persistent context** - Your core innovation
✅ **Readiness tracking** - Don't code until ≥70%
✅ **GitHub integration** - External memory
✅ **Methodology as code** - Templates sync globally
✅ **Terminal dashboard** - View all 150 projects
✅ **Production polish** - Error handling, colors, help docs

## 📊 Comparison to Agent Relay

| Feature | Agent Relay | Idea Factory |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Value Prop** | Sub-5ms agent messaging | Work on 150 ideas without chaos |
| **Installation** | `npm install -g` | `curl ... \| bash` |
| **Tech Stack** | TypeScript + Rust | Pure Bash (0 dependencies*) |
| **Dashboard** | Web UI (localhost:3888) | Terminal UI |
| **Commits** | 2,022 | 1 (clean start) |
| **Funding** | $1.5M | TBD 😉 |

*Requires: git, gh (GitHub CLI)

## 🎯 What Makes This Fundable

### 1. Clear Problem → Solution
**Problem:** Context loss kills AI productivity
**Solution:** File-based persistence + readiness tracking

### 2. Proven Need
- You're already using it for 150+ projects
- Real pain point in AI development
- Growing market (AI developers)

### 3. Network Effects
- More users = more methodology templates
- Community-driven improvement
- Open source → community → paid features

### 4. Monetization Paths
- **Free:** CLI tool (current)
- **Pro:** Web dashboard, team collaboration
- **Enterprise:** Self-hosted, security, SSO
- **Cloud:** Hosted persistence, sync across devices

### 5. Ecosystem Play
- Integrates with Claude Code
- Can integrate with Cursor, Continue, etc.
- MCP protocol support (like Relay)

## 🔥 Next Steps to Share

### 1. Share with Your Friend (Today)

Send them:
```
Hey! Check out what I packaged up:
https://github.com/pauljump/idea-factory

It's persistent context for AI development - solves the problem
of losing context between sessions.

Install: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauljump/idea-factory/main/install.sh | bash

Try: if-setup test-idea

I'm using it to manage 150 projects. Would love your thoughts!
```

### 2. Launch on Twitter/X (This Week)

Thread:
```
I built infrastructure that lets me work on 150 ideas with AI
instead of just 1-3.

The secret? Persistent context that survives session closure.

Say "continue" and full context restores instantly.

Open source: github.com/pauljump/idea-factory

🧵👇
```

### 3. Product Hunt Launch (Next Week)

- Create demo GIF/video
- Write compelling description
- Get 5-10 friends to upvote
- Be active in comments

### 4. Hacker News Show HN (Next Week)

Title: "Show HN: Idea Factory – Persistent Context for AI Development"

Opening:
```
Hey HN! I built this to solve my own problem: losing context
when working on multiple ideas with AI.

I was building 3 side projects but starting every Claude conversation
from zero. Now I work on 150 projects and context persists forever.

The breakthrough: file-based conversation logs + automatic insight
extraction + readiness tracking.

Tech: Pure bash, zero dependencies (except git/gh).

GitHub: https://github.com/pauljump/idea-factory

Would love feedback!
```

### 5. Claude Forum Post (Ongoing)

Share in Claude community as case study of building with Claude.

### 6. Optional: Landing Page

Create simple site at `ideafactory.sh` with:
- Hero: "Work on 150 ideas without chaos"
- Demo video
- Testimonials (yours!)
- Installation button
- Link to GitHub

Use GitHub Pages (free) or Vercel.
